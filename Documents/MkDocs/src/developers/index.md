Precompiled SDKs and Tools
--------------------------

For your convenience, we make available pre-compiled SDK and tools for the most popular platforms. Visit the [Download Page](/downloads/) for details.

There is one SDK for each target platform. Once you download the SDK for your platform, you must unzip it. You will obtain a directory named Bento4-SDK-. (ex: Bento4-SDK-1-4-3-607.universal-apple-macosx for version 1.4.3-607 on Mac OSX).
In the SDK directory, you will find the following subdirectories:

  * `bin` ==> precompiled tools, scripts and shared libraries
  * `docs` ==> documentation
  * `include` ==> C++ header files for the API
  * `lib` ==> static libraries
  * `utils` ==> tools and scripts
